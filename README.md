Bank Loan Data Analysis Dashboard- 
Project- 
This is a multipage Tableau project for a bank loan dashboard that visualizes the bank's loan portfolio and helps the bank managers to analyze the loan data and make informed decisions. The dashboard includes multiple pages, each with a different set of visualizations that provide insights into various aspects of the bank's loan portfolio.

Data Source-

The data for this project is taken from the bank's loan management system. It includes information about the loan applications, loan amount, loan status, borrower's details, and other relevant information. The data is extracted using SQL queries and stored in a CSV file.

Pages -
Overview The overview page provides a high-level summary of the bank's loan portfolio. It includes the total loan amount, Total Investment, and Total Fund. The visualizations on this page help the bank managers to get a quick overview of the loan portfolio and identify any trends or patterns. I have majorly worked on 5 KPIs.
